            "<p>Chemotherapy is a widely used treatment for cancer that involves the use of powerful drugs to destroy cancer cells. It is an essential component of cancer treatment and is often combined with surgery, radiation therapy, or targeted therapies. The goal of chemotherapy is to stop or slow the growth of cancer cells, which multiply rapidly.</p>",
            "<h2>How Chemotherapy Works</h2>",
            "<p>Chemotherapy drugs target rapidly dividing cells, which include cancer cells. However, some healthy cells, such as those in the bone marrow, digestive system, and hair follicles, also divide quickly, which is why chemotherapy can cause side effects. The drugs work in various ways:</p>",
            "<ul>",
            "<li>Preventing Cell Division: Some drugs interfere with the cancer cell's ability to divide and multiply.</li>",
            "<li>Damaging DNA or RNA: Certain drugs damage the genetic material inside cancer cells, preventing them from growing.</li>",
            "<li>Blocking Nutrient Supply: Some chemotherapy drugs cut off the supply of nutrients that cancer cells need to survive.</li>",
            "</ul>",
            "<h2>Types of Chemotherapy</h2>",

            "<ul>",
            "<li>Alkylating Agents: These drugs damage the DNA of cancer cells, preventing their replication.</li>",
            "<li>Antimetabolites: These drugs mimic the normal building blocks of DNA and RNA, disrupting cancer cell growth.</li>",
            "<li>Antitumor Antibiotics: These drugs interfere with cancer cell DNA, preventing it from multiplying.</li>",
            "<li>Mitotic Inhibitors: These drugs stop cancer cells from dividing by targeting proteins needed for cell division.</li>",
            "<li>Topoisomerase Inhibitors: These drugs interfere with enzymes that help cancer cells divide.</li>",

            "<li>Oral Chemotherapy: Pills or capsules taken by mouth.</li>",
            "<li>Injection: Direct injection into muscles or under the skin.</li>",

            "<li>The patient’s overall health and response to treatment</li>",
            "<li>Whether chemotherapy is combined with other treatments</li>",
            "</ul>",
            "<p>For some patients, chemotherapy can lead to complete remission, meaning no detectable cancer cells remain. In other cases, it helps shrink tumors, relieve symptoms, or slow down the progression of the disease.</p>",
            "<h2>Conclusion</h2>",
            "<p>Chemotherapy remains one of the most effective treatments for cancer, despite its side effects. Advances in medical research continue to improve chemotherapy techniques, making them more targeted and reducing adverse effects. Patients undergoing chemotherapy should work closely with their healthcare team to manage symptoms and maintain a good quality of life.</p>",
